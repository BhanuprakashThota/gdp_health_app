# Work Planning
1. We have joined repo created by Annie.

Repo link: https://github.com/annie0sc/gdp_health_app (Links to an external site.) 

Later, I have joined the zoom meeting call hosted by sprint planning team for about an hour.
We have discussed our views and points on work flow to approach further for development of the application. Our UI / Theme design group had a conference call for about 40 minutes and discussed our roles and started working.

1. As a UX/UI Developer in UI / Theme design group, I will be responsible for applying interactive and visual design principles on websites and web applications for a positive user experience. We will discuss about the client requirements about the design of the application and tools we are going to use in the application. 

1. We will be working in a single repo and work individually on assigned tasks.

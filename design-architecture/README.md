# Design Architecture

## Introduction

As part of design architecture team, we are responsible for creating and maintaing the structure of the application and making sure that it meets the Client requirements.

We discussed among the team and agreed on the point that, this project is better delivered if we use agile methodology which follows continuous development and testing. Agile allows changes in development requirements which is an added advantage if we want to implement new changes in future.

## Team Members

## Team Meetings:

## Tasks we did as part of Agile

## Understanding the requirements :
 
 - We read RFP, understood and analyzed the requirements clearly to formulate the design of the application. Also we identified
 the stakeholders required to implement the project.
 
## Formulating the design :

- We discussed on creating better solution which meets all the client requirements. Also we discussed on tools and technologies
to be used which delivers most reliable and cost efficient project.

## Communicating the designed architecture :

We planned to communicate our views to other designed units and ensure that everyone understands the architecture.

## Discussion on Tools and Technologies :

### Express FrameWork:

**Advantages of express FrameWork**
- Minimalistic and fast web framework
- Easy to setup and straightforward to learn
- Great routing API
- Availability of large number of plugins for use
- Offers numerous HTTP utility methods to build dynamic and perceptive APIs  
Reference: https://expressjs.com/

### Connecting to different databases from express framework:

### Testing Tools:

1. [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
- Advantages of Cypress: https://dzone.com/articles/why-should-you-switch-to-cypress-for-modern-web-te
2. [Mochajs](https://mochajs.org/)

### Formatter & Linters:

1. [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
2. [JSLint](https://jslint.com/)
3. [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
4. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## General Queries:

### what back end languages and platforms will you test?  
  
  we have decided to use java Script as back end language and the frame work as express.js.

### What formatters (e.g prettier (Links to an external site.)), what linters (e.g. ESLint (Links to an external site.) for JavaScript)?  
 
  we gonna use prettier in visual studio and JSLint for javaScript

### what devops tools (e.g. Husky (Links to an external site.) for GitHub) do you want to use? 

  We can implement the project using continuous integration and development tools like Jenkins for testing and packaging the application.

  For building or compiling the project, we can use Maven.

  We can deploy the application using Apache TomCat web server, which helps for implementation of the Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java Expression.

### What datastores will you test? Who will try each possible option?   You must have at least one industry standard implementation. (Java, C#, or Node on the back-end) - work with data team.

   In order to keep up with the current technology pace we should learn and practice with more languages, technologies, libraries and platforms, not to mention the planning, architect, development, deploy and maintain an entire application and the stack it run by the whole project team be planned in making the architecture.

# Queries:

- what back end languages, platforms will you test? 
- Who will create an initial project with A&A (Authentication and Authorization) to test drive this stack? 
- What formatters (e.g prettier (Links to an external site.)), what linters (e.g. ESLint (Links to an external site.) for JavaScript), 
- what devops tools (e.g. Husky (Links to an external site.) for GitHub) do you want to use? 
- What datastores will you test? Who will try each possible option?   You must have at least one industry standard implementation. (Java, C#, or Node on the back-end) - work with data team.

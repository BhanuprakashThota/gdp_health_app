1. I have spent 1 hour in class on wednesday hosted by Dr.Badami.Then i have noted a brief notes regarding the class and got an overview of the module2. Our team design Data held a meeting regarding the class, ER diagrams and also about the meeting of unit leaders from UI,Data,Sprint and Design/Architecture teams. I accepted a github invitation link for the application and one of our team mate created a Design data folder in the repository,here we can commit individual contributions as well as the total work of our team.

Github Design Data folder: https://github.com/annie0sc/gdp_health_app/tree/master/Design%20Data
My contribution : https://github.com/annie0sc/gdp_health_app/tree/master/Design%20Data/Contributions/Bharath
Zoom meeting: ![Zoom](https://github.com/annie0sc/gdp_health_app/blob/master/Design%20Data/Zoom_Meeting.png)

2. On friday, i need to work on some issues related to my jira account.Our team has a scheduled zoom meeting on friday so that we can discuss about individual teammate roles and the further steps of our design data group.

3. I am confused as we are interlinked to other team members, we have to wait for our tasks and also we have several issues with Jira as well as Github merge conflicts.

- Our team also discussed about a meeting hosted by "Sprint planning" team and the points they had discussed.
- We discussed what we have to on Friday and how we'll work on it.
- On Friday, I will be dealing with defining and reviewing the entities of ER and also discuss modifying the ER diagram if needed do the required changes as our group member has already added a basic ER diagram to the repo.

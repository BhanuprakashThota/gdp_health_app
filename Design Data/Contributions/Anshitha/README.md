Module 2: Work Planning

- I had attended Dr. Badami's class on 09/09/2020 and while discussing the project, I have noted some points which will be helpful for our project contribution and development.
- I accepted git invitation from Annie who created Git repository for this project.
- I have attended [zoom meeting](https://github.com/annie0sc/gdp_health_app/blob/master/Design%20Data/Zoom_Meeting.png) with our "Design Data" team mates on 09/09/2020. We have discussed our roles and responsibilities in this module.

- Our team also discussed about a meeting hosted by "Sprint planning" team and the points they had discussed.
- We discussed what we have to on Friday and how we'll work on it.
- On Friday, I will be dealing with defining and reviewing the entities of ER and also discuss modifying the ER diagram if needed do the required changes as our group member has already added a basic ER diagram to the repo.

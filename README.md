## Client FeedBack (WalkTracker Team/Modeul 1 Group 3)
1. We have proposed market tab in the app so that users who gain points through step count can redeem their points in the market tab to but university products like t-shirts.But the feedback we received from the client was,to retain the points but asked to change the market tab insted give some badges to users based on reward points.
2. Client asked us to not use the work Hydration level,instead use Water Intake of user.
3. Client was happy with the overall look and color of the app.
